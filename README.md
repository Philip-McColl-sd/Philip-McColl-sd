# Hi there! üëã

I'm an **Electrical Engineer** from **Universidad T√©cnica Federico Santa Mar√≠a (UTFSM)**, currently working at **Coordinador El√©ctrico Nacional de Chile** as both an electrical engineer and software developer. 

I combine power systems expertise with software development to create robust solutions for the Chilean electrical grid.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Skills

### Power Systems & Engineering
- **DigSilent PowerFactory** - Power system analysis, load flow studies, and grid simulation
- **MATLAB** - Numerical computing, data analysis, and algorithm development

### Software Development
- **Python** - Data science, automation, scientific computing, and backend development
- **.NET** - Enterprise applications, desktop development, and web services
- **Linux** - Extensive experience with Linux systems and administration

## üí° What I Work With

I bridge the gap between electrical engineering and software development, creating solutions that combine:
- Power system modeling and analysis
- Data-driven engineering insights
- Scalable software applications
- Automation and optimization tools
