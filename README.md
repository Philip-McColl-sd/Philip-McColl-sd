I am a Chilean electrical engineer and full-stack developer specializing in building intelligent, high-impact solutions that combine technical rigor, systems thinking, AI, systems programming and real-time problem solving.

My projects span power systems analytics, embedded AI, network tools, kernel manipulation, DSLs, and data visualization systems. I build tools that work—efficient, scalable, and production-ready critical systems for Chile's electrical grid.
